The code is split into two main parts, the UI and the Algorithm. The Wrapper is used to communicate between the two and keep everything together, you can think of it like the glue between
the UI an the algorithm.

The UI is setup in FX3D which creates the screen and can handle all of the UI events, like: rotation, zooming an user input. It makes use of UIParcel and Pentomino to 'easily' create shapes
and insert them.

Algorithm is where the problem actually gets solved.

test is used only to test out the code.

inputDetail is used to store the input from the user in a more easy-to-use manner.

Take a look at Program.uml for an overview of the structure.
