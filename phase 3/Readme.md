Phase 3:
In Block 1.3, we want you to build a computer application with a user friendly interface that can be used for solving the so-called three dimensional knapsack problems:

Assume that your company owns trucks with a cargo-space of 16.5 m long, 2.5 m wide and 4.0 m high. Assume that your company transports parcels of three different types: A, B and C. The sizes of the types are:

A: 1.0 x 1.0 x 2.0
B: 1.0 x 1.5 x 2.0
C: 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.5

A parcel of a given type also has a certain value. Denote these values by vA, vB and vC for types A, B and C respectively. Now, make a computer application that computes, for a given set of parcels (that may or may not fit into a truck), a packing that maximizes the total value. 

The application does not necessarily have to find the best answer in all cases, but it should be able to find a good approximation. The application should also make a 3D-visualization of its answer – from different perspectives. 

Use your application to answer the following questions:

a.	Is it possible to fill the complete cargo space with A, B and/or C parcels, without having any gaps?
b.	If parcels of type A, B and C represent values of 3, 4 and 5 units respectively, then what is the maximum value that you can store in your cargo-space?

Once you have answered these questions, assume that your company now transports pentomino shaped parcels of types L, P and T, where each of these pentominoes consists of 5 cubes of size 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5.


 


Adapt your application from Phase 1 to answer the following questions:

c.	Is it possible to fill the complete cargo space with L, P and/or T parcels, without having any gaps?
d.	If parcels of type L, P and T represent values of 3, 4 and 5 units respectively, then what is the maximum value that you can store in your cargo-space?

In case you are wondering, all the phases of this project are motivated by “packing” problems in computer science. These are very natural problems that occur when you want to make the most economically efficient use of a given space, subject to conditions on the total size of the space, the shapes of the items you are packing, and their value. It probably won’t surprise you to learn that good algorithms for packing problems are important in, for example, shipping container loading. The knapsack problem is a typical example of a combinatorial problem. Combinatorial problems are very common in operations research, applied mathematics, and theoretical computer science. In combinatorial problems exhaustive search is generally not tractable, and heuristic solutions needs to be found (near-optimal solutions). Other common problems involving combinatorial optimization are the travelling salesman problem or the minimum spanning tree problem.

At the end of this phase, you will upload the final code, presentation and report to your group repository on GitHub. Deadlines for uploading material and schedules for the assessment moments of phase 3 will be announced on the Student Portal.
