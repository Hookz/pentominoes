## Project phases
Project is divided into three phases mostly for grading purposes. There is no need to create separate folders for each of them, since every next phase is highly reliant on the previous one (unless it is done for archiving purposes).

### Project opening
* 4\. October 2019 (Friday)
* Theme of the project: **PENTOMINOES**

### Phase 1
* 7-11\. October 2019 (Monday-Friday)
* One week of intense research and coding
* [Presentation](https://maastrichtuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/m_jarski_student_maastrichtuniversity_nl/ERRieGPd155Lv6NO142-3roBFrunsT8fx-fTwOs-5qtXBw?e=IVcVqU) on 11\.10 at 10.00-10.15 with findings and planning: ROOM 2.002, Bouillonstraat 8-10

* Project meetings:
  * October 8, 2019
  * October 10, 2019
  * Time: 15.40 - 16.00
  * Location: Room 0.009/2.009 (Bouillonstraat 8-10)

### Phase 2
* 28\. October - 13\. December 2019
* Whole period for both courses and project
* Adding things missing from Phase 1 + working on Phase 2

* Phase ends a *weekend* before exams

### Phase 3
* 6-24\. January 2020
* Whole period for only project
* Phase 3 work + writing experiments
* [Final report](#latex-report)
