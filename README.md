# Project-1-1
This project is about building a computer program that is able to manipulate a set of pentominoes to achieve objectives planned for each of the project's phases.

The project is divided into three phases: Phase 1, in which the program is to be implemented in a way that enables it to fill up a given rectangle with given objects - *pentominoes*, Phase 2, in which a Tetris game that uses the pentominoes as game pieces is to be developed, and Phase 3 - the last phase - in which an algorithm has to be designed to solve three dimensional *knapsack* problems using pentominoes.

The associated JAVADOC can be found [on this GitHub Page](https://hookz.github.io/pentominoes/javadoc/).

## Project phases
Project is divided into three phases mostly for grading purposes. There is no need to create separate folders for each of them, since every next phase is highly reliant on the previous one (unless it is done for archiving purposes).
